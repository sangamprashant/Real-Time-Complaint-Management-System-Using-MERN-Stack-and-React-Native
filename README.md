## **4. Problem Statement**

In many organizations, institutions, and public service environments, complaint handling is still performed using manual or semi-digital methods. These traditional systems are time-consuming, inefficient, and lack transparency. Users are often unaware of the current status of their complaints, while administrators face difficulties in tracking, prioritizing, and resolving issues efficiently.

There is no centralized platform that provides **real-time updates**, proper tracking, accountability, and analytics. This leads to delayed resolutions, poor communication, and dissatisfaction among users.

Hence, there is a strong need for a **Real-Time Complaint Management System** that can digitally register, track, process, and resolve complaints efficiently using modern technologies.

---

## **5. Objectives of the Project**

The main objectives of this project are:

* To develop a **digital platform** for complaint registration and management
* To provide **real-time status tracking** of complaints
* To improve transparency and accountability in complaint resolution
* To enable administrators to efficiently assign and resolve complaints
* To maintain a **secure and centralized database** of complaints
* To generate reports and analytics for performance evaluation

---

## **6. Scope of the Project**

The scope of the project includes:

* User registration and authentication
* Complaint submission with description and attachments
* Real-time complaint status updates
* Role-based access for users, staff, and administrators
* Complaint assignment and resolution workflow
* Notification system for status changes
* Report generation and data analysis

The system will be implemented as a **mobile application using React Native** and a **web-based admin dashboard using React**, supported by a backend server developed with **Node.js and Express.js**, and a database using **MongoDB**.

---

## **7. Proposed System**

The proposed system is a **Real-Time Complaint Management System** that allows users to submit complaints through a mobile application. Once a complaint is registered, it is stored securely in the database and made available to the administrator through a web dashboard.

The administrator can assign complaints to staff members, monitor progress, and update the complaint status. Users receive real-time notifications regarding status updates, ensuring transparency and effective communication.
